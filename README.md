## Description

Though it is not stressed enough, a well-written and thoughtout README file is an indicator of the overall quality of a GitHub repository and its code. It helps to explain the why of it all, why anyone should care about this project (and therefore use it), and how it'll make the world better. 

I will say that I do spend significant time working on my README.md files after my projects are (seemingly) complete, so this project will definitely be utilized for future endeavors as well! It is my sincere wish that with time, I can make this better, faster, and easier to use so that others may utilize it as well. 

As always, I continue to learn everyday and with every project that there is so much more to learn and refine. I learned how to properly use module.exports, I re-learned placement of functions matter, even though my code and logic are (pretty) spot on, and I learned that I can indeed use my newfound knowledge (read: powers) can be used for such convienent good!

If you have any questions, suggestions for improvement, I have included my contact information in the Questions section.
